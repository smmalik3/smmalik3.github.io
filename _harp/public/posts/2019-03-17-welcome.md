Thanks for checking out the new site, check back often as I continue to build new applications and share my work and progress.

You can always check out my github repo directly by going [here](https://github.com/smmalik3/smmalik3.github.io)

>I've built this site by using Harp JS. It's my first crack at it and it seems really cool.

I will write a post on how to build one of these guys soon. For now, feel free to browse and get in touch with any questions. :D
